# Goal 
A simple movies API with frontend and database.

# Movie model
name, year, genre, my rating (float) and a review (my description).

# Stack
NextJS
For ORM use Prisma

# Requirements
Get all movies
Post a movie
Put or patch a movie
Add a search movies API endpoint
Add a search bar in the UI in the list view

# Methodology
Use TDD to create the app.

# Notes
First create the API and database part so that I can test it with Postman. If I'm happy continue with the UI.
