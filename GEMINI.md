# Rules

Do not commit yourself
Do not add the page name as a comment to the top of the page
Do not add comments for imports
If I created a model or constant to abstract some of your code, do not replace this with your code again (like defaultMovie)
If I say continue with next task, continue with the latest .md file in the /tasks folder

# Stack

Use NextJS with typescript and Prisma as ORM.

# Methodology

Use TDD to create the app.
