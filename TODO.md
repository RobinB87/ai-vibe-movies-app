# Todo list. Do not start working on this until I add it to the requirements.

Search when adding a new movie? So user can click the name.
Verify all tests
Refactor getting user session so we do not need to paste the same code all the time. Probably can use a decorator?

Add user type to DB + only admins can edit movies

If I decide later to add other users reviews / ratings these should be visible as well (anonimized)
Show overall rating of the movie as well
Show other users reviews, anonimized
Add AI function in app to translate a review to your requested language

Fix tests for updating a movie without rating / review.
Fix height for movie card in the grid. Just use like 150 height and end review with ... if it does not fit.
Implement Playwright MCP
Also implement the react context for the watchlist?
Movie genre should be array

Refresh session with seven days everytime user does something.
