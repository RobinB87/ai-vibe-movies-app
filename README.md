# Goal
This is a test project to vibe code a NestJS fullstack project with Gemini CLI

# Setup
Start with creation of the GEMINI.md file.

# Notes
As free Gemini model did not handle creation of the ORM very well, I did this myself after it was finished with the rest of the backend part:
* https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/nextjs

Then I let it continue.
