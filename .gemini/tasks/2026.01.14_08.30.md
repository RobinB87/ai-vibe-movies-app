# Requirements

Create a new feature branch with git
For the following requirements,
Create a new prisma model which will hold the rating, review and isOnWatchlist of the current movie model.
For the database modeling this means: - movies will become unique based on title and year - many users can create one review for a movie

Do not remove these properties yet from the movie model.
Only create the prisma model, the TS types and the migration, so do not update the API and UI yet. I first want to inspect the modeling when you are done.
