# Goal

A simple movies API with frontend and database.

# Movie model

name, year, genre, my rating (float) and a review (my description).

# Requirements

Get all movies
Post a movie
Put or patch a movie
Add a search movies API endpoint
Add a search bar in the UI in the list view
Create a migration for the movie model with a new boolean property isOnWatchlist, by default this property should be undefined
Then update the API (POST vs EDIT) accordingly
Then update the UI (POST vs EDIT) accordingly
Add button to only show films on the watchlist
Make the review and rating property optional
Remove edit button in the movie card. Show a light hover animation (expand the card with 0.1) and show a pointer. Clicking on the card should go to the edit page.
Ensure API is not called constantly. First, start with adding debounce on search.
Second, after adding or updating a movie just update the movie list locally as well. As we are going to a different page we might need to have some statemanagement or a react context.
Create a new git branch and then: create a new user model email, name and password. Create the typescript type in the types folder. Then create an endpoint to POST and GET one user.
Create a login endpoint

# Notes

First create the API and database part so that I can test it with Postman. If I'm happy continue with the UI.
